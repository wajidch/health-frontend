Luckily, Corewood eased all his worries, and he has since looked forward to visits from the caregiver! Such individualized attention is rare in today's health landscape. I really appreciate all the stress they relieved from our family, and it's been a joy to seem my dad feel more independent and confident. I can't recommend Health Aide enough.",

We had caretakers that worked so well with my father and figured out how to treat him that they created a solid bond. The home was always clean, appointments always kept, good healthy food given and any money they had to spend for my father was recorded with receipts. When we did have a conflict of character between the caregiver and my father it was remedied within a few days; efficiently, quickly, without drama and for the better of all parties. I live out of state from my dad and knowing that Health Aide had things under control was such a relief for me being miles away and taking care of my own family.
